# Release notes for v4021

## Support for offline SDK licensing
This release has two new methods in the Helpers class: `GetAssemblyHash` and `VerifySDKLicenseCertificate`.

If you want to check that the entry assembly was signed properly, you can use the `VerifySDKLicenseCertificate` method
as shown below. If the verification succeeds (the certificate is found and is valid), a LicenseKey object will be returned.
Otherwise, the method will return null.

```cs
string RSA = "RSA Pub key";
if(Helpers.VerifySDKLicenseCertificate(RSA) != null)
{
    // all ok.
}
else 
{
    // signature incorrect.
}
```

The `GetAssemblyHash` is a helper method to `VerifySDKLicenseCertificate` and is not intended to be used on its own. However,
it can be useful when debugging or when a customer has issues getting it to work. This method returns an `AssemblySignature`
object, which contains the path to the assembly and its SHA512 hash.
