title: Release notes for v404
---

# Changes since the previous release

* Renamed the assembly to `Cryptolens.Licensing`. The same version numbering is still used.
* Add support for metadata that is returned when either calling `Key.Activate` or `Key.GetKey` (this is only available if you are targeting .NET Framework 4.6 or above).
* Build for .NET Framework 4.0 and 4.6 and also for .NET Standard 2.0.
    * **.NET Framework 4.0** - Verifying metadata signatures is not supported.
    * **.NET Framework 4.6** - All features supported.
    * **.NET Standard 2.0** - Computing machine codes is not supported. You can still use the available hash functions to compute a machine code, assuming you can collect machine specific information.
