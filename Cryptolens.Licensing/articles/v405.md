# Release notes for v405

## Floating licenses
Add [floating license](https://help.cryptolens.io/licensing-models/floating) support in the activation method (see [FloatingTimeInterval](/api/dotnet/api/SKM.V3.Models.ActivateModel.html#SKM_V3_Models_ActivateModel_FloatingTimeInterval)) and in the methods that check if the license key certificate belongs to the correct machine (see [IsOnRightMachine](/api/dotnet/api/SKM.V3.Methods.Helpers.html#methods)).

> [!NOTE]
> To use `IsOnRightMachine`, you need to target the .NET Framework version of the library. .NET Standard does not currently support this method. As a workaround, you can use your own machine code function. Keep in mind that when floating licenses are used, `floating:` prefix is appended to the original machine code.
