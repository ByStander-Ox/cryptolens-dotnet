# Release notes for v4020

## List all products and their properties

We have added a new method that allows you to get a list of all your products and their properties. For example, you can see all the associated data
objects, feature definitions, etc. It can be called as shown below:

```cs
public void TestGetProducts()
{
    var auth = AccessToken.AccessToken.ProductMethods;
    var result = ProductMethods.GetProducts(token: auth, parameters: new RequestModel());

    Assert.IsNotNull(result);
    Assert.IsTrue(result.Result == ResultType.Success);
}
```

## Record Usage

If you want to record usage for a certain subscription (in our recurring billing module), you can use the `RecordUsage` method,
which will call Stripe's API and register the usage for a subscription item associated with the license key. It can be called
as shown below:

```cs
public void TestRecordUsage()
{
    var auth = AccessToken.AccessToken.SubscriptionMethods;
    var res = Subscription.RecordUsage(auth, new RecordUsageModel { Amount = 1, ProductId = 3349, Key = "CMXKC-GUQRW-EJUGS-RRPUR" });

    Assert.IsTrue(res != null && res.Result == ResultType.Success);
}
```
