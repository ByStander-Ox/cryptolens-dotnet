# Release notes for v4012

## Overdraft floating licenses

Overdraft license works by allowing to the end users to temporarily exceed the maximum number concurrent machines (for floating licensing).
You can set this up in two steps.

### Step 1
First, add `FloatingTimeInterval` and `MaxOverdraft` (see [this](https://help.cryptolens.io/licensing-models/floating) tutorial)

```cs
var auth = "{access token with permission to access the activate method}";
var result = Key.Activate(token: auth, parameters: new ActivateModel()
{
    Key = licenseKey,
    ProductId = 3349,
    Sign = true,
    MachineCode = Helpers.GetMachineCode(),
    FloatingTimeInterval = 100, // needed for floating licenses
    MaxOverdraft = 1            // needed to allow overdraft
});
```
If max number of machines is set to 1, then we will allow the user to exceed this by 1 (specified by `MaxOverdraft = 1`).

> [!NOTE]
> When the user exceeds the max number of machines for floating licenses, a special event, "2015" will be created. You can read more about how they can
be retrieved [here](https://app.cryptolens.io/docs/api/v2/WebAPILog).

### Step 2

The second step is to is to ensure to set `allowOverdraft=true` when verify if the license is bound to the correct machine, as shown below:

```cs
if(Helpers.IsOnRightMachine(res2.LicenseKey, isFloatingLicense: true, allowOverdraft: true))
{
    // everything OK!
}
```

## Custom machine code

The IsOnRightMachine method now supports a custom machine code as input.
