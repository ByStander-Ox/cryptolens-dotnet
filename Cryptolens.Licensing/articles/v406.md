# Release notes for v406

## Add trial key support
Add [CreateTrialKey](https://help.cryptolens.io/api/dotnet/api/SKM.V3.Methods.Key.html#SKM_V3_Methods_Key_CreateTrialKey_System_String_SKM_V3_Models_CreateTrialKeyModel_) method, which allows trial key creation within your software. Each trial key is going to be node-locked to the device that requested it.

You can read a more detailed tutorial [here](https://help.cryptolens.io/examples/verified-trials).

## Other changes
The decrement int value method found in the DataObject class was calling IncrementIntValue instead, which is now fixed. You can read more about it [here](https://github.com/Cryptolens/cryptolens-dotnet/issues/24). Note, this bug did not affect users who used the static Data class.
