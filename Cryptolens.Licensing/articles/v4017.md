# Release notes for v4017

## Support for Unity with the new protocol

The method `HasValidSignature` has returned false even if the signature was correct in earlier versions. To fix this, we have
introduced support for the new protocol (used in eg. the Java and C++ clients), which resolves this issue.

Instead of calling Key.Activate that takes in an `ActivateModel`, you can call it as shown below:
```cs
var result = Key.Activate(token: auth, productId: 3349, key: "GEBNC-WZZJD-VJIHG-GCMVD", machineCode: "foo");
```

This will return a `RawResponse` object. In order to obtain the license key, you can call

```cs
var license = LicenseKey.FromResponse("RSAPubKey", result);
```

## Save and load from string

In addition to methods that allow you to save and load from file, we have also added `SaveAsString` and `LoadFromString` in case you would like to
store the serialized license in a different way.

## Data objects with activations

It's now possible to associate a data object with a machine code (assuming the machine code is registered with the license key). The name size was increased to 100 chars and the limit of 3 data objects was removed.
