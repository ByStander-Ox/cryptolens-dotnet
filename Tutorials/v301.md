# Release notes SKM Client API (v.3.0.1)

![](http://download-codeplex.sec.s-msft.com/Download?ProjectName=skgl&DownloadId=373033&Build=21031)

## Three concepts
In the new version of SKM API, we essentially mimic the
[Web API 3](https://serialkeymanager.com/docs/api/v3/).
There are three main groups of methods: [Key Methods](https://serialkeymanager.com/docs/api/v3/Key),
[Data Object Methods](https://serialkeymanager.com/docs/api/v3/Data),
and [Product Methods](https://serialkeymanager.com/docs/api/v3/Product). In addition, there is also a group called
[Auth Methods](https://serialkeymanager.com/docs/api/v3/AuthMethods), but it's only used to improve security
in specific use cases.

Each of the three categories of methods work with a certain object. For example, [Key Methods](https://serialkeymanager.com/docs/api/v3/Key) 'work' with
a **LicenseKey** object, so it is natural to find methods such as _Activation_, _AddFeature_, etc, in that group,
since all of the methods affect a license key. Similar can be said about the remaining groups.

Fortunately, you will most likely not need to use these methods right away (they are located in `SKM.V3.Methods`).
Instead, you will use methods that are associated with the object. In this way, many things will be abstracted away.

### License Key
In most scenarios, this will be enough for a simple licensing solution. To access this object, you need to include
`SKM.V3`. We can do things like blocking the license, adding features, activating, and more. 

### Data Object
A data object can be thought of as an **additional variable** that we can associate with a key, a product or
our entire account. For example, it might be the customer name, the number of times a certain feature has been used,
etc. In the latter case, we can, for instance, set up a scenario where a certain license key may only be used say 
300 times. Each time it is used, we decrement the counter until a value is reached. _For old SKM users, this is 
the same as the OptionalField_. 

### Product
A product is a container of license keys. At this point, there is little support for product operations, as they
are not essential in most of the use cases.


## Examples

### Get license information
Let's support that you've created a new product and your first license key at [skmapp.com](http://skmapp.com).
There are three things you need to be able to access the license key in your application:
* The product id: you can find it [here](https://serialkeymanager.com/docs/api/v3/getkey), by 
selecting it from the list and then looking in the **ProductId** parameter, eg. `3349`.
* The key string, eg. `LEPWV-FOTPG-MWBEO-FBFPS`.
* An access token that has the **GetKey** permission, eg. `WyIxNzIiLCJhak9OT1g3NW90YlQyRFFVUzBWdnlGSHJYdUpMdDA0REMxNzNOa2duIl0=`. You can
generate a new access token [here](https://serialkeymanager.com/User/AccessToken#/).

The simplest way to get license key data is by using `Refresh` that each license key object has.

```
string token = "WyIxNzIiLCJhak9OT1g3NW90YlQyRFFVUzBWdnlGSHJYdUpMdDA0REMxNzNOa2duIl0=";
string key = "LEPWV-FOTPG-MWBEO-FBFPS";

var license = new LicenseKey { ProductId = 3349, Key = key };
license.Refresh(token);
```

Now, all the missing fields will be replaced with the ones found in the SKM platform. If this is not intuitive,
you can also use `Key.GetKey` found in the `SKM.V3.Methods`. But the solution above is better, right?
