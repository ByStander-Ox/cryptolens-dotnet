# Release notes SKM Client API (v.3.0.1)

![](http://download-codeplex.sec.s-msft.com/Download?ProjectName=skgl&DownloadId=373033&Build=21031)

## Three concepts
In the new version of SKM API, we essentially mimic the
[Web API 3](https://serialkeymanager.com/docs/api/v3/).
There are three main groups of methods: [Key Methods](https://serialkeymanager.com/docs/api/v3/Key),
[Data Object Methods](https://serialkeymanager.com/docs/api/v3/Data),
and [Product Methods](https://serialkeymanager.com/docs/api/v3/Product). In addition, there is also a group called
[Auth Methods](https://serialkeymanager.com/docs/api/v3/AuthMethods), but it's only used to improve security
in specific use cases.

Each of the three categories of methods work with a certain object. For example, [Key Methods](https://serialkeymanager.com/docs/api/v3/Key) 'work' with
a **LicenseKey** object, so it is natural to find methods such as _Activation_, _AddFeature_, etc, in that group,
since all of the methods affect a license key. Similar can be said about the remaining groups.

Fortunately, you will most likely not need to use these methods right away (they are located in `SKM.V3.Methods`).
Instead, you will use methods that are associated with the object. In this way, many things will be abstracted away.

### License Key
In most scenarios, this will be enough for a simple licensing solution. To access this object, you need to include
`SKM.V3`. We can do things like blocking the license, adding features, activating, and more. 

### Data Object
A data object can be thought of as an **additional variable** that we can associate with a key, a product or
our entire account. For example, it might be the customer name, the number of times a certain feature has been used,
etc. In the latter case, we can, for instance, set up a scenario where a certain license key may only be used say 
300 times. Each time it is used, we decrement the counter until a value is reached. _For old SKM users, this is 
the same as the OptionalField_. 

### Product
A product is a container of license keys. At this point, there is little support for product operations, as they
are not essential in most of the use cases.


## Examples

### Get license information
Let's support that you've created a new product and your first license key at [skmapp.com](http://skmapp.com).
There are three things you need to be able to access the license key in your application:
* The product id: you can find it [here](https://serialkeymanager.com/docs/api/v3/getkey), by 
selecting it from the list and then looking in the **ProductId** parameter, eg. `3349`.
* The key string, eg. `LEPWV-FOTPG-MWBEO-FBFPS`.
* An access token that has the **GetKey** permission, eg. `WyIxNzIiLCJhak9OT1g3NW90YlQyRFFVUzBWdnlGSHJYdUpMdDA0REMxNzNOa2duIl0=`. You can
generate a new access token [here](https://serialkeymanager.com/User/AccessToken#/).

The simplest way to get license key data is by using `Refresh` that each license key object has.

```
string token = "WyIxNzIiLCJhak9OT1g3NW90YlQyRFFVUzBWdnlGSHJYdUpMdDA0REMxNzNOa2duIl0=";
string key = "LEPWV-FOTPG-MWBEO-FBFPS";

var license = new LicenseKey { ProductId = 3349, Key = key };
license.Refresh(token);
```

Now, all the missing fields will be replaced with the ones found in the SKM platform. If this is not intuitive,
you can also use `Key.GetKey` found in the `SKM.V3.Methods`. But the solution above is better, right?

### Checking properties

Another common task is to check the license key details and decide whether some features in the
application should work or not. To solve this, we have extension methods (located in `SKM.V3` namespace).
Let's reuse the variable `license` from the above example. We will check that **feature 1** is set to true,
and that it has not expired.

```
if(license.HasFeature(1)
          .HasNotExpired()
          .IsValid())
{
    // do something
}
else
{
    // invalid license.
}
```

There are many methods, such as `HasFeature()`, `HasNotFeature()`, `HasNotExpired()`, `IsOnRightMachine()`,
`IsBlocked()`, `IsNotBlocked()`, `HasValidSignature()`. These allow you to express complex logic using
simple terms. However, to decide whether it is true or not (eg. satisfied), we need to call the 
`IsValid()` method.

### Storing a license key in a file
There are many ways to store a license key on the client device. If this scenario is used,
it's recommended to store a **signed** version of the license key object. SKM Client API comes 
with methods to achieve this task, but you can also use **Settings variables** to store this information.
Please read the following articles at MSDN:
1. [Creating a new setting][1] - you need one only, eg. to store a LicenseKey object.
2. [Writing to a setting][2] - after activation/refresh, you would store the result inside the 
setting
3. [Reading a setting][3] - when user restarts the application, you can use this setting to
reload the license key object.

### Activating a device
Key activation is the central method that empowers licensing solutions. The core idea is:

> Key Activation is a way to restrict the usage of a license key to a limited amount of devices
(aka machines)

The opposite of activation is deactivation.

SKM's activation method is very configurable as to support as many use cases as possible. Below,
we will focus on
